# Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects conducted on various datasets using Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL. Each project provides meaningful insights derived from the data analysis process.

## Overview

This repository contains EDA projects showcasing my data analysis skills across different tools and technologies. I have explored various datasets, deriving insights to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Technologies Used

- Excel
- Power BI
- Python
- SQL

## File Descriptions

- **Excel_EDA**: This directory contains EDA projects conducted using Microsoft Excel. The `Vrinda_store` file corresponds to a different dataset, where I have performed data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

- **PowerBI_EDA**: Here, you'll find EDA projects created using Power BI. The `E-Commerce` and `HR_Analyst` files represent different datasets, showcasing interactive visualizations and insights derived from the data.

- **Python_EDA**: This directory contains EDA projects implemented in Python. The `Google_Collab` file (.ipynb) provides step-by-step analysis using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

- **SQL_EDA**: Here, I have conducted EDA projects using SQL queries. The `Music_store` file demonstrates data exploration, transformation, and analysis performed directly on the datasets using SQL.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the contents of each directory to view the EDA projects conducted on different datasets. You can download the files and run them on your local machine using the respective tools and technologies mentioned.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the datasets used in these projects. Additionally, I appreciate the open-source community for providing valuable resources and support for learning and development.
